                <p class="bottom-paragraph">The very first step in this checklist is to decide if you want a pair of gaming headphones or a pair of gaming headsets.
            </p>
                <p class="bottom-paragraph">So what is the difference between gaming headphones and gaming headsets?
            </p>
                <p class="bottom-paragraph">Gaming Headphones = Regular Headphones + Separate Mic <br /> 
                Gaming headphones are regular headphones that are used traditionally for music enjoyment. However, they possess
                qualities that are awesome for gaming needs too. Audiophilic characteristics such as great micro-detail retrieval,
                accurate sound stage and immersive sound experience make them feasible to double up as a pair of gaming headphones.
            </p>
                <p class="bottom-paragraph">However, most audiophile headphones do not come with a mic nor do they have any mic attachment slots. You will need to
                get an external mic like the Blue Yeti X for communication support.</p>
                <p  class="bottom-paragraph">A professional gamer who uses a gaming headphones setup is Ninja, famous for streaming PUBG and Fortnight. He uses the
                Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro with Audio Technica AT2035 Cardioid Condenser Microphone while streaming his games.
            </p>
                <p class="bottom-paragraph">There are several benefits and drawbacks to using a gaming headphones setup for gaming.
            </p>
                <p class="bottom-paragraph">Benefits of Gaming Headphones <br />
                Higher upsides for audio and mic quality <br />
                As you have a wider product selection for both the headphones and mic itself, you are able to assemble your gaming setup
                with the latest mic and headphones.</p>
